# Weekend Project Dice Game

## Description

This project was taken as part of AppleSeeds Bootcamp, and was my first experience with React.

The project's main objective was creating and designing a dice game that tests your luck and strategy, which includes 1 Vs. 1 game mode.

Class and functional components have been used with sass as the main tool for styling.

### Rules

One Vs. One game, the players can choose their own nickname and the goal score for the game.

Every player can choose to hold the score they earn or to keep rolling the dice.

When a player hits double 6's he loses all his current score, and his turn ends.
<br>
<br>

### Winning Conditions

When the player hits the goal score, he wins.

If one of the players exceeds the goal, he automatically lose and the other player wins.
